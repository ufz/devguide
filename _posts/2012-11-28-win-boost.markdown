This guide will show you how to install Boost system-wide on **Windows**. There are also a guides for <strong><a href="/linux-boost">Linux</a></strong> and <strong><a href="/mac-boost">Mac OS X</a></strong>.

- Download the Boost installer for either [32-bit](http://boostpro.com/download/boost_1_51_setup.exe) or [64-bit](http://boostpro.com/download/x64/boost_1_51_setup.exe)

- Start the installer and leave all default options except:

    - Select *Visual Studio 2010* as a compiler and the *Multithreaded DLL* / *Multithreaded debug DLL* libraries:

    - Prefered installation directory is *C:\boost*:
    ![](http://d.pr/i/Cepp+)

    - Make sure that there were no errors during the installation. The installer loads stuff from the Internet during installation. Sometime it happens that something goes wrong during installation. If so please reinstall it.

- If have installed Boost in another directory than *C:\boost* then add your install directory to your *PATH*-environment variable, e.g.:
![](http://d.pr/i/QPrl+)

- You can see that Boost is correctly found when looking at the CMake output:
