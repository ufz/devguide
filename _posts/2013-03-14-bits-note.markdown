On Windows you decide at CMake-time if you want to compile a 32- or a 64-bit application. The 64-bit CMake generators are name with *... Win64*,
e.g. *Visual Studio 10 Win64* vs. *Visual Studio 10*. You cannot change the bit-architecture in the Visual Studio project later on but you can have
two build directories, one for 32- and one for 64-bits.

On Linux the bit-architecture is automatically set to match the architecture of the Linux installation. So usually you will compile a 64-bits application.
