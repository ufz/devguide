Have a look under the category buttons on the right to find the topic you are interested in. If you are new to OpenGeoSys it recommended to pass through our 4 steps tutorial:

1. In [Set Up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) you will learn how to install the Git client which will let you access the version control system
2. In [Set Up Prerequisites](/prerequisites-redirect) you will be guided the installation process of other required tools such as an IDE and CMake
3. Now it is time to [Configure your build](/configure-cmake-redirect) with CMake to get the configuration and feature set of OpenGeoSys you need
4. Finally you can [Build OpenGeoSys](/build-redirect) to create the executable
